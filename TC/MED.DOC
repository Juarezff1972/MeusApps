MED lets you create mouse pointers to include in your C programs very easy.
IF is a design tool used to interactively design mouse pointers for 
your C program. The output is a C structure compatible with Borland Turbo C
and Borland C++ for use with Microsoft Mouse Library.

Inside MED you have four pre-defined pointer types ready to use or modify.
You can also create your pointer from scratch.

The basic operations are:

"View Pointer"   - The mouse pointer will be replaced by the one
                   you just designed. Press the left button to return 
                   to normal operation.

"Clear All"      - Clear the current mouse pointer - Warning - No undo.

"Quit Program"   - Quit the program without saving the current pointer.

"Save Structure" - will generate a C structure that you can include in 
                   your C programs for use with the Borland Turbo C and
                   compatible compilers together with Microsoft Mouse
                   driver. You will be promted for filename - this is the
                   file to save the structure in. You will also be prompted
                   to give the name to your pointer, this will be the name
                   of the C structure.


 When you have created your mouse pointer, save it by pressing the 
 "Save structure"  button.

 If you created the structure mouse_pointer it will look like:

/* Mouse pointer definition created Tue Jan 28 11:57:55 1992      */
/* Generated by MouseEd V. 1.5. Code & design by Christer Janson. */

unsigned int mouse_pointer[32] = {
  0x3fff, 0x1fff, 0x0fff, 0x07ff, 0x03ff, 0x01ff, 0x00ff, 0x007f, 
  0x003f, 0x001f, 0x01ff, 0x10ff, 0x30ff, 0xf87f, 0xf87f, 0xfc3f, 
  0x0000, 0x4000, 0x6000, 0x7000, 0x7800, 0x7c00, 0x7e00, 0x7f00, 
  0x7f80, 0x7fc0, 0x7c00, 0x4600, 0x0600, 0x0300, 0x0300, 0x0180
};

To use the pointer definition you will have to pass the adress of the 
structure to the "SetMouseShape" function. In Borland C it can look like:

void SetMouseShape( int spotx, int spoty, char *data )
{
  struct REGPACK reg;

  reg.r_ax = 0x09;
  reg.r_bx = spotx;
  reg.r_cx = spoty;
  reg.r_dx = FP_OFF( data );
  reg.r_es = FP_SEG( data );
  intr(0x33, &reg);
}

A call to : SetMouseShape( 0, 0, (char *)mouse_pointer );
will set the mouse pointer to the pointer you just defined.

MED will create mouse pointers compatible with the Microsoft Mouse 
and Mouse driver.

Refer to Microsoft Mouse Programmers Guide or similar guides for a 
complete list of mouse interrupt 0x33 operations.

System Requirements:
--------------------
 * VGA Graphics
 * Microsoft or 100% compatible Mouse.

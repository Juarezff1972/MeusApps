This is usually not the way I "am for hire", however a lot of you have asked how they could use my services on a pay basis.  If you have a large project that need more attention than noted below, please <a href="mailme.htm">email</a> me for details on my full time services.<br>
<br>
Forever Young Software is owned and operated by me, Benjamin David Lunt.  Most contracts are for specialized software for a single purpose rather than general programming, although I still do general programming.<br>
<br>
I have done programs from utilities for the handicapped and special communications programs to specialized DOS utilities and system hardware.<br>
<br>
If you have a program you need a routine for, help with a problem, or a complete write-up, please send me the specs on it and I will reply as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
I only deal in contracts as either a percentage of the net/gross profits, or on a one-time pay deal. 
Once a  contract has been made, it is your responsibility to get all copyrights and other legal publications for your software.  I write the code and send you the executable with out source until first payment is made.<br>
<br>
All contracts including all documentation, source code, etc. are confidential and are never revealed to anyone.  Once a contract has been fulfilled, all correspondence is done with as you see fit.  If asked, I keep a copy of all correspondence for future use or as an alternative, delete any reference to it.<br>
<br>
Please <a href="mailme.htm">email</a> me if you are interested in becoming a client of Forever Young Software.<br>

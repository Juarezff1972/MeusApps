Please see REMARKS below.

NewBasic++ is a package for the beginner wanting to learn Basic and Assembly
as well as the advanced programmer interested in programming Basic and
Assembly in one intergraded environment.

INTERPRETER:
NewBasic++ package includes a Graphic User Interface (GUI) for the
interpreter.  It allows the user to enter the program and run it within
the GUI without having to exit the interpreter and taking all the steps to
compile the source until there is no more errors.  The display for the
GUI is changeable for better viewing and less eye strain.  You can change
the background color (paper color), the menu color(s), and the text of
the current document.  You can also make the comments, the NewBasic commands,
the NewBasic++ commands, and the rest of the code different colors to match
your tastes.

The NewBasic++ GUI interpreter will display the line of the current error,
allow the user to fix the error and, if able, to continue the program from
that point.  If it is not able to continue, it will start from the beginning.
It is also equipped with a lot of utilities to debug your program.  A 'jump
to next line to execute' command; a 'jump to previous line executed'; a
variable 'status'; a calculator, with DEC, HEX, OCT, and BIN conversions; and
also contains an inline help interface.

The NewBasic++ GUI interpreter will also allow inline assembly.  This inline
assembler is not a detailed or involved assembler, but allows the programmer
to do simple assembler programming as well as most DOS and BIOS interrupts.

ASSEMBLER:
The reason for the lacking of full capabilities for the inline assembler is
that the NewBasic++ package contains a full capability, separate assembler
package capable of creating OBJ and COM files.  The assembler takes an ascii
text file as source input and creates a COM file (if applicable) as default,
or, if specified, will create a Microsoft compatible OBJ file, ready for the
linking process.

COMPILER:
The compiler is included to compiler your NewBasic++ source code from the
command line.  The compiler takes an ascii text file for source input and
creates an assembler source file ready for the assemler above.

LINKER:
The NewBasic++ package also includes a linker to link a compiled or assembled
OBJ file to an EXE file.  The linker is a Microsoft compatible linker.

THE LIBRARIES:
The NewBasic++ package contains libraries that are/may be necessary for the
linker to create the EXE files.  The libraries are listed below.
  NBCOM10.LIB - is the basic command library for the compiler.
  NBCPP10.LIB - is the basic++ command library for the compiler.
  MOUSE.LIB   - a mouse library fully capable of all mouse functions
  MATH.LIB    - a math library which includes the x87 coprocessor instr.s


THE FILE UTILITIES:
The NewBasic++ package also includes a few file and memory utilities.
  EXE2COM - will test and convert an EXE file to a COM file.
 SHRNKEXE - will shrink an EXE files header by up to 512-28 bytes
  MEMORY  - will display Memory Control Blocks (MCB's) to allow you
             to view the memory used by your program and others.


REMARKS:  The NewBasic++ package is not completed at this time.  
Once the whole package is finished it will contain all files and
utilities listed and be released as a registered version.

Any questions, comments, or suggestions may be sent to me via the addresses
listed below.  The first released beta version will be announced and posted
on  http://www.zekes.com/~blunt/newbasic.html, with any bug fixes/patches
posted thereafter on the same place.  Thank you for your interest in
NewBasic++.  Any feedback will be welcome.

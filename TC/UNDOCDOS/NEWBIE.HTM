First, download the info zip file from <a HREF="newbinfo.zip">here</A> (16k) and unzip it (<a href="ftp://ftp.pkware.com/pub/pkware/pkz204g.exe">PKUNZIP</a> 2.04g recommended) in a directory of your choice, then view README.TXT<br>
<i>(To download, I suggest right clicking the link and saving to disk)</i><br><br>
This file contains info and diagrams/tables that every programmer (Novice or Advanced) should have pinned on the wall in front of them.<br>
Current Revision Date:  <font color=purple>20 Dec 1998</font> <br>
<br>
This page will contain information for the Novice who would like to learn more about programming and how to write efficient programs in Assembly, Quick Basic, C, and Pascal.<br>
If you would like to see any specific code and/or documentation on this page, just
<A HREF="mailme.htm">e-mail</A> me.  Being that this is a site devoted to the Novice, no question is to dumb.<br>

<a HREF="regsdemo.bas">REGSDEMO.BAS</A> (2k) is a small demo to show how to use assembler registers in Basic.<br>
<br>
<a HREF="menus.bas">MENUS.BAS</A> (2k) is a small demo to show how to create menus in Basic.<br>
<br>
<a HREF="pmouse.pas">PMOUSE.PAS</A> (1k) is a small routine to show how to use the mouse in Turbo Pascal.<br>
<br>
<a HREF="qcmouse.c">QCMOUSE.C</A> (4k) is a small routine to show how to use the mouse in Quick C.<br>
<br>
<a HREF="csize.zip">CSIZE.ZIP</A> (2k) includes a small routine to hide, show, or set the size of the cursor (from the DOS prompt).  It includes Assembly source.  The text file also includes how to hide and show the cursor in Assembly, Basic, and Pascal.<br>
<br>
<a HREF="qbmouse.zip">QBMOUSE.ZIP</A> (14k) Is a mouse library for QB45.  It allows the mouse to be used in your QB45 program.  All source is included, with an example.<br>
<br>
<a HREF="mzblstr.bas">MZBLSTR.BAS</A> (3k) is a Quick Basic 4.5 program that will allow you to enter a maze and it will return a result.<br>
This program is used to show how to use multidimensioned arrays.<br>
<br>
<a HREF="numbox.bas">NUMBOX.BAS</A> (1k) is a Quick Basic 4.5 program that solves a little well known puzzle.  I am sorry, I forgot the name of the puzzle, but it is the one where you are given the numbers 1-9 and have to put them in a 3x3 matrix where each direction equals 15.  This program will solve this puzzle for all add matrix squares from 3x3 to 19x19.  <i>This shows the secret to this puzzle so you will know how to solve any odd matrix square (even a 1000001 x 1000001 matrix)</i><br>
<br>
<a HREF="numbox.pas">NUMBOX.PAS</A> (2k) is the Pascal version of the above program<br>
<br>
<a HREF="snow.c">SNOW.C</A> (2.5k) is a QC25 sample program to show a snow-fall effect in screen mode 12.  This routine shows how to use random numbers, two dimensional arrays, and graphics in mode 12 (480x640x16 colors) (same as BASIC routine below)<br>

<a HREF="snow.bas">SNOW.BAS</A> (2k) is a QB45 sample program to show a snow-fall effect in screen mode 12.  This routine shows how to use random numbers, two dimensional arrays, and graphics in mode 12 (480x640x16 colors)<br>
<br>
<a HREF="prntfast.zip">PRNTFAST.ZIP</A> (2k) is an assembler sample program to show how to quickly print colored text to the screen.  See the bottom of the ASM file for documentation on the text video memory setup.<br>

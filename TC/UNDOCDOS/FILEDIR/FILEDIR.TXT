    Version:  1.02b
     Author:  Ben Lunt (Forever Young Software(R))
       Date:  10 Dec 1999
  Assembler:  MASM 5.10
   Compiler:  QB45


This package contains the following files:
      DEMO.BAS        The demo QB45 program to call FILEDIR
      FILEDIR.ASM     The MASM 5.1 assembler code for FILEDIR
      FILEDIR.OBJ     The OBJ file ready for link
      FILEDIR.QLB     The Quick Lib for use with QB45 interpreter
      FILEDIR.TXT     You are reading it.


DEMO.BAS is an example of how to call the assembler routine.

You must DIM an array of at least the amount of files assumed and each
array subset must be 12 bytes long.

FATTR% is sent as what attrib to get.
   1 --> Read only
   2 --> Hidden
   4 --> System
   8 --> Volume Label only
  16 --> Sub Dir's
  32 --> all regular files

You can mix and match.  i.e.:  1+2+4 (7) will return all files that are
  Read Only, Hidden, and System only.

DFiles$ is the file(s) to return  (you may use wildcards)


To use the QLB file in the interpreter, type the following at the DOS prompt:

  qb /l filedir demo


To link the OBJ file to a program you have made:

  link progname+filedir,,,bcom45;


History:
 10 Dec 1999 - 1.02b
    No version difference.  Only added a little better demo.bas

 16 Nov 1998 - 1.02b
    Fixed DIR attrib 'flag' bug, so that if you specify 16 in FATTR%, then
     this routine wouldn't return anything else until a restart.
    Thanks to Dan Badstubner for catching this bug.

  9 Jan 1998 - 1.01b
    Fixed DIR attrib.  If you specify 16 in FATTR%, then this routine
      will only return dir's.

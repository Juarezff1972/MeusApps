Download the CD player zip file from <a HREF="cdp.zip">here</A> (19k) and unzip it (<a href="ftp://ftp.pkware.com/pub/pkware/pkz204g.exe">PKUNZIP</a> 2.04g recommended) in a directory of your choice, then view CDP.TXT, CDPLAYER.TXT, and REGISTER.TXT<br>
<i>(To download, I suggest right clicking the link and saving to disk)</i><br>
<br>
To play a CD using CDP, type CDP at the DOS prompt and then follow the instructions.<br>
<br>
To play a CD using CDPLAYER, type CDPLAYER at the DOS prompt and use the mouse or the
keyboard.  Or use the /S parameter to start the CD and exit to DOS.  See CDPLAYER.TXT
for more info on the cd player and the user keys.<br>
<br>
Note:  Both assume that drive D: is your cd drive (directions to change it are included)<br>
Also:  Both assume that MSCDEX or a compatible driver is already installed and activated.<br>
(use autoexec.bat and config.sys)<br>
<br>
The assembly source code is included in the zip file for CDP.EXE to show how to program
the MSCDEX driver.  The Source is not included for CDPLAYER.EXE because it uses the same
content to access the MSCDEX driver.<br>
<br>
There is also a FAQ list by Marcus W. Johnson to help you write your own CD player.<br>

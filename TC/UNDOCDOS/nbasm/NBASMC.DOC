This is the documentation for the NBASMC library (version 00.00.00)

This library is for use with the NBasm assembler in the tiny model
using the .external directive.

For now, and for beta testing purposes, this library only contains
5 routines.  prtdec, prthex, prtbin, prtoct, and prtstring.

You call each of these with a parameter on the stack.

For example:
- if you want to print 1234d, you would (no negative numbers)

           push 1234        or   mov  ax,1234
           call prtdec           push ax
                                 call prtdec

(same for prthex, prtbin, and prtoct)

- if you want to print 'hello world', you would

           push offset msg1   or   mov  bx,offset msg1
           call prtstring          push bx
                                   call prtstring
msg1  db  'Hello world',0


Each routine cleans the stack on return.

Please note that the 'prtstring' routine requires a null terminated string,
or an asciiz string as we should call it.

After a while of beta testing, I will release the full library NBASMC.LIB,
along with complete documentation for each routine in the library.

Thanks for your beta testing,
Forever Young Software

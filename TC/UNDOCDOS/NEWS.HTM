<b>News as of 29 Sept 1998</b><br>
<i>Some utilities you got to have for Quick Basic 4.5 from Microsoft.</i><br>
Microsoft has three utilities for QB45 that I found interesting.<br>
- HMAKE100.EXE allows you to modify the existing help files to your wants, or create a whole new one to replace the existing one.<br>
- NOCOM450.EXE has an object file to include with your program to cut out 4k of the over head if you use the OPEN command with strings and not communications.<br>
- QB45CRIT.EXE has documentation and source to patch the current QB.LIB and QB.QLB files to fix the critical error hang.<br>
For more on these files and to download them see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/downloads/LNP429.asp?PR=CHS&T1=7d&FR=0&A=T&T=B&S=F&">here</a><br>

<b>News as of 01 Sept 1998</b><br>
If you own a <a href="http://www.gw2k.com"><i>Gateway 2000</i></a> machine with a <i>Telepath</i> family modem, you <b>must</b> look in to downloading their new driver update.  It will bring your 28.8k or 33.6k modem up to speeds that are comparable to the 56k modems.  Read all of their documentation to make sure that you can update your modem (I suggest that you ask one of the tech guys to make sure).  Once you have the 'go-ahead', download the driver and install it.  I am getting speeds of more than 42k on my 33.6k modem over a standard phone line.<br>

<b>I collect older documentation and some software</b><br>

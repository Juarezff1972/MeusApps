<H1>Ben Lunts' Most Used Links</H1>

<p align=left><font color=black size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">
<font color=blue>I have gone to many a links and have found very few actual pages/sites that have the information I need instead of just more links to another page with more links.  For this reason, I will start to create this links page of links to pages that have the information I am looking for rather than just more links.<br></font>
<br>
If you have a site or know of a site that is devoted to DOS programming, and has good information on it rather than just a bunch of links, I would like to see it.  Please send me an <A HREF="mailme.htm">e-mail</A> message with the preferred language in the subject line, and the address and a brief description in the body.  I may include it on this page (unless otherwise noted by you).<br>
<br>
<br>
For all the DOS commands and their parameters, take a look at <a href="http://log.on.ca/users/rhwatson/dos7/index.html">http://log.on.ca/users/rhwatson/dos7/index.html</a><br>

Do you have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020162687x/foreveryoungsoft">
Dissecting DOS</a> by Michael Podanoffsky?<br>
Here is a quote from his page: <i>"Th[is] book contains the full source code to RxDOS. It provides a thorough explanation of the internal architecture and is an excellent reference source."</i> [Api Software]<br>
His book has source code to a full work alike DOS operating system.  You can go to his home page and read more about it at <a href="http://rxdos.com">http://rxdos.com</a> and <a href="http://rxdos.com/dissectingDOS.html">http://rxdos.com/dissectingDOS.html</a>.<br>

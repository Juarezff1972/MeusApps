Type CDP at the prompt and then follow the instructions

 Note:  CDP assumes that drive D: is your cd drive
          (you can change it easy enough)
  Also:  CDP assumes that MSCDEX or a compatible driver
          is already installed and activated.
          (use autoexec.bat and config.sys)

This code is freeware.  You may use this code as you wish, but PLEASE
leave me the credit if you distribute it anywhere.  Also, (for my own
protection), if this code, in any way, does bad things to your machine,
I am not responsable.

This code was quickly put together and does have a few bugs that
could be taken out, but all-in-all the know-how is described well
enough.  If you see an error or have a suggestion or question about
CDP please e-mail me and I will do my best to help out.

PLEASE DO NOT PUT YOUR FIXED VERSION ON THE WEB.  E-MAIL ME WITH
YOUR FIXED CODE AND LET ME PUT IT ON THE WEB IN ITS' ORIGONAL PLACE
AND IN ITS' ENTIRETY.

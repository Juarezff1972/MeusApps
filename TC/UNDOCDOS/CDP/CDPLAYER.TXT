Version History:
-----------------------------------
CDPlayer    v1.03    released on 04/13/97      (a.k.a  CDP)
    This was the DOS command line version (No GUI)
    This version was released with the assembly code

CDPlayer    v2.00    released on 05/26/97  (beta version)
    This version had a Graphic User Interface (GUI), which includes
      mouse support.
    This version also allowed you to pick-up where you left off without
      reseting the Player.  (prevoius version did not)
    This version was not quite finished.  It doesn't allow command-line
      parameters yet.  It also doesn't have the two skip-forward and
      skip-backward buttons working correctly.  (both due to be in next
      version which is coming out soon)

CDPlayer    v2.02e   released on 05/27/97
    Notice the 'e' on the version number.  I added a small 'easter egg'
      in the program.  Can you find it?  Let me know and you will have
      credit for it on my web page.
    Added the command line parameters.
      /D:n - n=2-9 where 2 = C:, 3 = D:, etc.  (n = 3 is default)
      /S  starts the CD on the first track and then exits to DOS (no GUI)
         (see above for more)
    As v2.00, this version is not quite finished.  It doesn't have the two
      skip-forward and skip-backward buttons working correctly.
      (due to be in next version which is coming out soon)

CDPlayer    v2.12e   released on 04/28/97
    -Final Beta version-
    Now has the two skip-forward and skip-backward buttons working correctly.
    Probably will add Continous Play (continue with 1st track when done with
      last track) in next version.

CDPlayer    v2.14e   released on 04/28/97
    Fixed the bug where if hit << or >> key will not playing.
    Also fixed the two << >> buttons so they skip more prec.ly.

CDPlayer    v2.15e   released on 04/29/97
    Reset to first track when hit STOP

CDPlayer    v2.25e   released on 05/11/97
    Revamped error checking.  Much better error checking was installed.

Playwav (version 1.02b) is a simple utility to play a .WAV file.  It will
 only play .WAV files with a 11000 Freq. and the file must be less than
 50k (51200 bytes) in length.  This file is distributed as freeware and
 should remain that way.  It is distributed to show how to play a WAV file.
 It should be very simple to make it play larger WAV files, and at different
 freqencies.  (maybe later versions)

 NOTE:  This util is set to play on PORT 220h at Channel 1.  You can change
   it to match your system by change a few numbers.
     If you use Channel 0:
       PgPort  = 87h
       AddPort = 00h
       LenPort = 01h
       ModeReg = 48h
     If you use Channel 1 (default set):
       PgPort  = 83h
       AddPort = 02h
       LenPort = 03h
       ModeReg = 49h
     If you use Channel 2:
       PgPort  = 81h
       AddPort = 04h
       LenPort = 05h
       ModeReg = 4Ah
     If you use Channel 3:
       PgPort  = 82h
       AddPort = 06h
       LenPort = 07h
       ModeReg = 4Bh

    You can also set the freq different as long as you don't set it higher
     than 29999.  (This util is not set to run at high freq.  Maybe next
     version)

    The Quick Basic 4.5, the Turbo Pascal 6.x, and the MASM 5.1x source code
     is included.  You may modify them as you wish, as long as you do not
     distribute them.  If you find an error or a better technique, please
     email me and I will modify them, then redistribute them (I even leave
     you credit for the fix/technique).

     *I did not test the BAS code as an executable.  I did however run it
     in the Quick Basic 4.5 interpreter with know problems*

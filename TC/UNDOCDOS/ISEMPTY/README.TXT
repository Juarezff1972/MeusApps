This is a rountine that will check the length of
a file for zero length (null length).  It will
return in ERRORLEVEL:
  FALSE (0) if not null length
  TRUE  (1) if is null length
  ERROR (254) file not found
  ERROR (255) environment string not found

This is freeware.  You may do what you want with it as
long as you leave me the credit when credit is due.

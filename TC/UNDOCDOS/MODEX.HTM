The Standard VGA mode 13h is the easiest and fastest color graphics programming.  It uses
a single long, linear bitmap, with each byte controlling one pixel.  If I had a bitmap of
320x200 with 256 colors with each pixel represented by a single byte, I can quickly put
that bitmap on the screen by copying it to memory location 0A000:0000h.  This makes for
extremely fast screen updates and flicker free animation.  Also, if I have a small bitmap
of 25x25 that I want to scroll across the screen, All I need to do is put the background
on using the tech. above and then copy the 25x25 space of the background into a temp memory
position, copy my 25x25 bitmap to that location, wait, copy the saved 25x25 background bitmap
back into its place and move to the next position.  This way I don't even touch the rest of
background, and makes for even faster and better animation.  I could even get better animation
by rotating through 3 or more 25x25 bitmaps of a man walking while moving across the screen
to give a better representation of animation.<br>
<br>
Mode X is the undocumented mode of the VGA.  It is very close to Mode 13h (320x200x256)
except it has more vertical pixels (320x240x256) and we have to send our data to the VGA's
registers rather than just putting it into 0A000:0000h<br>
<br>
You can also program the VGA to have a resolution of 320x400 with 256 colors.  This mode
is still 13h but we now use 4 bitplanes.  The standard VGA mode 13h is really a 320x400
res. mode, except the designers wanted to only use 64k so they made each line display
twice, hence the 320x200 res mode.  If we use 4 bitmaps, now we can take control of that
second printed line.<br>
<br>
In this discussion, I will include a source code listing for a small animation demo for the
standard VGA mode 13h.  You can get a copy of it <a HREF="ani.zip">here</A>, or below, and
unzip it (<a href="ftp://ftp.pkware.com/pub/pkware/pkz204g.exe">PKUNZIP</a> 2.04g recommended) in a directory of your choice, then view ANI.TXT for
more info on running the demo and view the source code (MASM 5.1).<br>
<br>
As far as the rest of the graphic modes described on this page, I suggest that you get a
copy of the following book.  It is a very good, source filled documentation on all the
graphical modes of the CGA, EGA, VGA, MGA, MCGA, and many more.  It includes a CD with all
the code on it, and the complete text to his book, <i>Zen of Assembly Language</i>.<br>

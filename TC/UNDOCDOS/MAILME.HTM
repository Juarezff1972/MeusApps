<b>I receive a lot of mail each day</b> and I try to answer all of it.  If I get an error when trying to reply such as <i>delivery problems</i> or <i>server not found</i> I do not try to resend it.  So if you do not get a reply with in about 5 days, please resend the message and carefully check the reply address.<br>
<br>
<b>When replying</b> to me, please always include my message so that I can refer back to it.  Some letters I get have one-liners or answers without the question and I have no idea what they are referring to, so I reply with the original message.<br>
<br>
If you plan to <b>include an attachment</b> with your message please make sure that it is <u>10k or less</u>; that includes email and all attachments.  If you need to send me something larger, please contact me first with a description of what you are about to send.  If I receive an email message with a large attachment and I have not been contacted of this, I will discontinue loading that message and will not look at it.<br>
<br>
Please include all information on what <b>OS and compiler/interpreter</b> that you are using.  If I know this info, I can answer your question a lot faster and more detailed to what you need.<br>
<br>
<b>There is no fee</b> for any information or code that I look at, respond to, or send you.  All I ask is that you tell your friends where they can receive the same kind of help.  If you put a link to my page on your page, that would be more than enough payment, <i>but is not required</i>.<br>
<br>
<b>I will not do your homework</b>.  If you need some help with your code, please try it yourself first.  Then when you get stuck, I will be more than happy to help you.<br>
<br>
Sorry about all the hog-wash but this helps me serve you better.<br>

PLATFORMS:
DOS on a FAT16 disk.

DESCRIPTION:
LFNDir is a command line program that lets you view long filenames under DOS.
Its syntax is almost identical to the DOS DIR command, and its output looks
like what you get when you issue a DIR command in a Windows 95 DOS box.

REVISION HISTORY:
Initial release.

INSTALLATION:
To install LFNDir, copy the file LFNDir.exe to a directory that is in your
path (for example, the Windows COMMAND directory). For information on command
line options, go to a DOS prompt and type:

	LFNDir /?

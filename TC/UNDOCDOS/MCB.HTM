Download the source code from <a HREF="mcb.zip">here</A> (9k), and unzip it (<a href="ftp://ftp.pkware.com/pub/pkware/pkz204g.exe">PKUNZIP</a> 2.04g recommended) in a directory of your choice, then view MCB.ASM and/or MSTRENV.ASM file for details.<br>
<i>(To download, I suggest right clicking the link and saving to disk)</i><br>
<br>
 - To use MCB just type MCB at the DOS prompt.<br>
MCB will show you what each Memory Control Block has and the source explains in more detail how it is done.<br>
<br>
 - To use MSTRENV just type MSTRENV at the DOS prompt.<br>
MSTRENV was assembled with <a href="newbasic.htm">NBASM</a>.<br>
MSTRENV shows what is in the master environment and the source explains how to get it.  Once you have
the address and size of the master environment, then you can modify it with out error as long as you don't exceed the size.<br>
<br>
 - SETPATH is also included to show how to added to the PATH= string variable.  See the .ASM source to see how to use it.  SETPATH was also assembled with <a href="newbasic.htm">NBASM</a>.<br>
<br>
The assembly source code is included in the zip file for both MCB.EXE, MSTRENV.COM, and SETPATH.COM.<br>

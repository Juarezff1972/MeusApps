This Assembler routine will allow you to show, hide, or change the current
size of the cursor.

   Usage  CSIZE sf <enter>

Where s = starting scan line (a number of 0 through 7)
      f = finish scan line (a number of 0 through 7)
      <enter> = the enter key
  
To hide the cursor, enter '00'
To display the cursor, enter a non zero in both (DOS's Default is '67').
Note:  This small routine only uses 0 through 7 as input.  Any other might
  cause errors.  (This routine does not check the bounds)



*ASSEMBLY*
Bit 5 of CH defines whether to show or hide the cursor.  If bit 5 is set,
 the hide cursor, if it is clear, then show cursor.

CurOff:    mov  ah,01h                  ; turn off cursor
           mov  ch,00100000b            ; bit number 5
           int  10h                     ;

Bits 0-3 of CH are the starting scan line bits (values 00h - 0Fh)
Bits 0-3 of CL are the finishing scan line bits (values 00h - 0Fh)
 -CGA uses 0 as top (start) and 7 as bottom (finish) (default is 6,7)
 -MDA and EGA uses 0 as top and 13 as bottom (default is 11,12)
 -MCGA and VGA uses 0 as top and 15 as bottom (default is 13,14)
 -Some SVGAs allow 0 as top and 31 as bottom (allowing 32 scan lines)

CurOn:     mov  ah,01h                  ; turn cursor on
           mov  cx,0607h                ; 6 = start, 7 = finish scanline
           int  10h                     ;


*BASIC*
In Quick Basic 4.5 use the following line(s) to show/hide the cursor

  LOCATE , , 0         ' to hide
  LOCATE , , 1, s, f   ' to show (with s as Start and f as Finish scan line)


*C*
I do not yet know of a C function to show/hide the cursor


*PASCAL*
In Turbo Pascal 6.0 use the following line(s) to show/hide the cursor

  HideCursor;          { to hide the cursor}
  ShowCursor;          { to show the cursor}

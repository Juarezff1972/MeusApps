Info wanted:

        I'd like to finish the lightwave -> off conversion, and only
need to get a description of each of the texture "chunks", and how
the information is used to 1) take a 2D texture and slap it on a polygon
(from what I've seen, all the information is in 3D, but since textures are
 2D, I dunno...)  2) for the 3D textures, it would be nice to have the
equations that the chunks are used in, otherwise I'd have to wing it...

Hardware access desired:

        Pixcon 1.03 was the last version that was fully tested on
an SGI platform with/without multiple processors.  While I was optimizing
the multiscan/multframe code in Pixcon, I changed jobs, and lost access.
I eventually finished the new multi routines, but have been unable to test
them for SillyGee's, as well as any other new code that I've added.  If
someone has an SGI w/ a few cycles to spare, I'm looking either for someone
to test/debug Pixcon or allow me access...

Acknowledgements:

Since the IJPEGG requests code change documentation, this section acknowledges
that the IJPEGG jpeg library is used by Pixcon, and has been slightly altered
to:
        1) not exit when an image is not found
        2) to return the image as a bitmap

Special thanx for the following people:

Independent JPEG Group for providing the jpeg library on the net...

Sam Leffler and SGI for making the Iris .rgb spec and the tiff library
        available on the net, and for the template for the copyright notice
        below, with the names changed to protect the innocent :)

Thomas Meyer who wrote an ilbm decoder from which I based mine on.

Allen Hastings who made available a document explaining some of
        the lightwave 3d object format (I'm still looking for
        docs on how the texture chunks are used...)

Ken Musgrave for the initial sbfast code (he's changing the name to
        quad-tracing, but I'm not...)

Ken Perlin for providing the noise function

Compuserve Inc for providing the GIF 89a document on the net

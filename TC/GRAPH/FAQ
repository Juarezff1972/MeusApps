Q:	When I compile, the compiler reports multiple occurances
	of function 'x'

A:	Pixcon/Anitroll was written using C++.  Your system is
	probably defaulting to the C compiler.  There are 2 ways to
	fix this:  The hard way is to edit the Makefiles in
	graph/src, graph/src/jpeg, graph/prog, and graph/anitroll so that
	the variable "CC" is set to your C++ compiler (I didnt mention
	graph/src/tiff because its a "C" library).  The easy way is to
	compile graph/src/tiff first, then set the environment
	variable "CC" to your C++ compiler and compile the rest.

Q:	When I compile, I get a bunch of errors due to a missing
	"glx.h" file

	or

	I get a bunch of errors due to undefined "glxxx" functions

A:	You probably don't have an OpenGL library, or haven't specified
	where it is on your system.  Pixcon looks for the OpenGL
	include files in /usr/include or /usr/local/include (actually in
	/usr/local/include/GL), and the libraries in /usr/lib or usr/local/lib.

	If you have the libraries already installed somewhere else,
	you'll have to edit the Makefiles in graph/src , graph/prog ,
	and graph/anitroll or set the environement variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	to point to it.

	The SGI version assumes that you have native SGI OpenGL, and the
	linux version assumes that you have MesaGL.

	If you dont have the OpenGL library, there is a freeware
	implementation available from:

                ftp://iris.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/Mesa/
                http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html

	I have tested Pixcon w/ Mesa 1.28 and 2.2 w/o any problems.

Q:	I'm using an SGI, and (for some strange reason) am using g++
	as the compiler, and I get a bunch of errors around line 83
	of shader.c .  Whats wrong?

A:	I made the mistake in assuming that all SGI computers came
	with a native C++ compiler.  There are some #ifdefs around
	line 83 that I used to differentiate the SGI native C++ compiler
	from other compilers.  Just comment out the #ifdefs and the
	SGI specific line, leaving the other option alone, and it
	should work.

Q:	The MANUAL keeps referring to "tokens" - what are they?
			or
	Pixcon saying that my script has invalid tokens, but they
	look ok.  Whats wrong?

A:	A token is a character string that is separated by white
	space (<space>, <tab>, <eoln>, <eof>, etc...)  Make sure
	that each token is separated by white space -> this includes
	the comment token as well.

	ex:

	invalid -	//hi there
	valid -		// hi there
